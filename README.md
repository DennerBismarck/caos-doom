Microprocessor and Architecture Simulation

This repository is focused on developing Microprocessor architecture simulations using Logisim Evolution.

Currently, these are the projects developed: 

1. MiniMIPS 16 bits single-cycle 
2. MIPS 32 bits multi-cycle without pipelining (in dev)


For future ideas, we look out to do:

3. MIPS 32 bits single-cycle
4. MIPS 32 bits multi-cycle with pipelining

Note that the second project has many stages of hazard detection and optimization implementations, we ought to develop those as well.
