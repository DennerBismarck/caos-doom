# MAS
Microprocessor and Architecture Simulation

This repository is focused on developing Microprocessor architecture simulations using Logisim Evolution.

Currently, these are the projects developed: 

1. MiniMIPS 16 bits single-cycle 
2. MIPS 32 bits multi-cycle without pipelining (in dev)


For future ideas, we look out to do:

3. MIPS 32 bits single-cycle
4. MIPS 32 bits multi-cycle with pipelining

Note that the fourth project has many stages of hazard detection and optimization implementations, we ought to develop those as well.

# Using the MIPS ASM Coder

To use the MIPS ASM Coder, you should first compile it to an executable using the command below:

```console
gcc -o main main.c -lm
```
After compiling the code, follow the instructions below to run it:


After you finish the main program, your instructions should be programmed into a file named with the filename given.
