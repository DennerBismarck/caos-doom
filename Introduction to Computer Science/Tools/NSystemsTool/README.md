# Number Systems Tool

This project has the objective to create a software that initially is capable of:

1. Handling multiple basis conversions and arithmetics
2. Producing LaTeX align structures that simulate "as in-school" arithmetic
3. Producing interactive ways for students to grasp different basis arithmetic

Future ideas include:

1. Making it a non-terminal software with proper presentation
2.
