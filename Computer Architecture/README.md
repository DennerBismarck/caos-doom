# Computer Architecture Research and Material

Here are listed some of the research done by undergraduate Iago Gouveia Gurgel about Computer Architecture:

1. MAS

Ideas to be implemented are:

1. Experimental guides on microprocessor simulation with Logisim (SAP-1 / SAP-2 / SAP-3 / 6502)
2. Experimental guides on memory controller for Caches and DRAM
3. KiCAD for experimentation with more eletrical purposes
